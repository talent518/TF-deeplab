# TF-deeplab

This is a Tensorflow implementation of [DeepLab](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLab.html), compatible with Tensorflow 1.2.1.

Currently it supports both training and testing the ResNet 101 version by converting the caffemodel provided by Jay. 

Note that the current version is not multi-scale, i.e. only uses the original resolution branch and discarding all layers of 0.5 and 0.75 resolution.

The `caffemodel2npy.py` is modified from [here](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/blob/master/tensorpack/utils/loadcaffe.py), and the `deeplab_model.py` is modified from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/resnet/resnet_model.py).

## Example Usage
- Download the prototxt and caffemodel [provided by Jay](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLabv2_resnet.html)
- Convert caffemodel to npy file
```bash
python caffemodel2npy.py deploy.prototxt ../deeplab/ResNet101/init.caffemodel ./model/ResNet101_init.npy
python caffemodel2npy.py deploy.prototxt ../deeplab/ResNet101/train_iter_20000.caffemodel ./model/ResNet101_train.npy
python caffemodel2npy.py deploy.prototxt ../deeplab/ResNet101/train2_iter_20000.caffemodel ./model/ResNet101_train2.npy
```
- Convert npy file to tfmodel
```bash
python npy2tfmodel.py 0 ./model/ResNet101_init.npy ./model/ResNet101_init.tfmodel
python npy2tfmodel.py 0 ./model/ResNet101_train.npy ./model/ResNet101_train.tfmodel
python npy2tfmodel.py 0 ./model/ResNet101_train2.npy ./model/ResNet101_train2.tfmodel
```
- Select cuda gpu devices id
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```
- Test on a single image
```bash
python deeplab_main.py single
```
- Test on the PASCAL VOC2012 validation set (you will also want to look at the `matlab` folder and run `EvalSegResults.m` after you run the following command)
```bash
python deeplab_main.py test
```

- To train on the PASCAL VOC2012 `train_aug`, run
```bash
python deeplab_main.py train
```

## Performance

The converted DeepLab ResNet 101 model achieves mean IOU of 73.296% on the validation set of PASCAL VOC2012. Again, this is only with the original resolution branch, which is likely to be the reason for the performance gap (according to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00915.pdf) this number should be around 75%).

## TODO

- Incorporating 0.5 and 0.75 resolution
